In my quest to understand how git works, I'm adding content to
a new file in ScriptingGames, and will manipulate the repo in
several different ways to get a better appreciation of git
operations.

Updating this content to confirm git is still working after performing an upgrade to Mojave.
I would not be surprised if I have to update some of the command line tools to make it work.

Additional testing of the VS Code running on a MacBook Pro. This Apple Silicon based laptop 
is going to be a challenge for some software development tooling. THe arm64 architecture is
not univerally supported yet, so I expect some hicups getting my environment setup.

Above two paragraphs were from a block copy operation in Warp. Very clean - no prompt garbage like I observed before.
The oh-my-posh theme in effect during this period was craver.omp.json.

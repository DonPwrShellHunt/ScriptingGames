In my quest to understand how git works, I'm adding content to
a new file in ScriptingGames, and will manipulate the repo in
several different ways to get a better appreciation of git
operations.

Updating this content to confirm git is still working after performing an upgrade to Mojave.
I would not be surprised if I have to update some of the command line tools to make it work.

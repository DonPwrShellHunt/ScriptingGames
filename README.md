Edited using MS Code on 5/13/15.
Even though I used MS Code to make the last update, it was not aware of the git operations
that I performed via Tower on my iMac. This change however, is going to be one I play with
totally within the Code framework to see how it handles git.

VS Code was able to handle updating a file (README.md), going through a commit, and doing 
a sync using the Code git interface elements. This particular update is being done via Code,
but I want to see if Tower detects the file change, and process this change through Tower to 
confirm my authentication change continues to work. 

Updated GitHub on Win10 after updating authentication info. This modification will confirm
if VS Code git integration is still working.

Powershell scripts submitted to scripting games
Edited using MS Code on 5/13/15.
Even though I used MS Code to make the last update, it was not aware of the git operations
that I performed via Tower on my iMac. This change however, is going to be one I play with
totally within the Code framework to see how it handles git.

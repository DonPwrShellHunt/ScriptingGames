Edited using MS Code on 5/13/15.
Even though I used MS Code to make the last update, it was not aware of the git operations
that I performed via Tower on my iMac. This change however, is going to be one I play with
totally within the Code framework to see how it handles git.

Updated GitHub on Win10 after updating authentication info. This modification will confirm
if VS Code git integration is still working.
